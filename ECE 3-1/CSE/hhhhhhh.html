                                    <p>Sri Lanka's Pathum Nissanka (L) celebrates after scoring a double century (200
                                        runs) as Charith
                                        Asalanka during the first one-day international (ODI) cricket match between Sri

                                        Afghanistan at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium in Kandy on 9
                                        February 2024.</p>
                                    <p>Pathum Nissanka became the first Sri Lankan to score an ODI double century,
                                        powering the hosts to an
                                        immense 381 against Afghanistan at Pallekele in their series opener on Friday.

                                        The opener finished unbeaten on 210 to break the island nation's longstanding
                                        record of 189 by
                                        Sanath Jayasuriya against India in 2000.

                                        It was also the joint fifth-highest individual score in ODIs.

                                        Sri Lanka's 381-3 was also their highest at the ground and the team's
                                        fourth-highest on record.

                                        The unstoppable Nissanka's knock included 20 fours and eight sixes from the 139
                                        balls he faced in
                                        his first ODI since the World Cup.

                                        Avishka Fernando was dismissed for 88 after he was caught by Ibrahim Zadran at
                                        backward point in the
                                        27th over.

                                        Skipper Kusal Mendis took the crease next but failed to make an impact and fell
                                        for 16.

                                        Sadeera Samarawickrama smashed 44 off 36 deliveries in his 120-run partnership
                                        with Nissanka.

                                        Fareed Ahmad claimed the wickets of Samarawickrama and Fernando to be the pick

                                    <p>Although research is one of the major responsibilities of a university, a
                                        concerning trend of
                                        ignoring this responsibility persists in some universities across the country.

                                        Some 15 per cent of private universities, including some old ones, did not have
                                        allocations of a
                                        single penny for research in 2022. A similar situation was found in some newly
                                        established public
                                        universities.

                                        Conversely, the prominent universities kept comparatively higher allocations for
                                        research, and it is
                                        reflected in their overall academic performance, according to the University

                                    <p>Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan was granted bail in 12 cases related to
                                        9 May riots by an
                                        anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Rawalpindi, The Express Tribune reported.

                                        Additionally, Khan's close aide and the former foreign minister of Pakistan,
                                        Shah Mahmud Qureshi was
                                        granted bail in 13 cases, the daily reported.

                                        Imran was also granted bail in the GHQ and Army Museum attacks, with the court
                                        requiring a PKR0.1
                                        million surety bond in all 12 cases.

                                        The bail applications were considered by ATC judge Malik Ejaz Asif. The court
                                        ruled that there was
                                        no rationale for keeping the PTI founder in custody, and all suspects in the 9
                                        May cases were
                                        granted bail.

                                        Imran and Qureshi were indicted as per charges on 6 February. The duo was
                                        brought before the court,
                                        and the former prime minister informed the judge that he had been unjustly
                                        arrested on 9 May from
                                        the grounds of the Islamabad High Court (IHC), according to The Express Tribune.

                                        Imran was booked in many cases relating to the rioting that erupted throughout
                                        the country on 9 May,
                                        following his detention in a corruption case. The complaints filed in Rawalpindi
                                        included an attack
                                        on the gate of General Headquarters (GHQ), rioting at a sensitive institution's
                                        office, and other
                                        incidents.

                                        He rejected the claims included in the cases' first information reports (FIRs).

                                        It should be mentioned that, following his release from Adiala jail, PTI leader
                                        Shah Mehmood Qureshi
                                        was hauled away by Punjab police in connection with the attack on the GHQ,
                                        according to The Express
                                        Tribune.

                                        In July last year, a high-level joint investigative team (JIT) looking into the
                                        9 May violence
                                        decided to designate the former premier in two terrorist cases, including an
                                        attack on GHQ.

                                        With the inclusion of new sections to the proceedings, the PTI head was charged
                                        with planning and
                                        inciting violence.

                                        The bail has been granted to Imran Khan at a time when the results of the
                                        Pakistan General Elections
                                        that took place on 8 February are highly anticipated.

                                        Khan on Saturday released a 'victory speech' in his AI-enabled voice, saying

                                        of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo Nawaz Sharif failed with the

                                        voters on polling day, as he also claimed victory in the general elections.

                                        Moreover, Nawaz Sharif also announced his intention to form a united government
                                        with the help of his
                                        former allies - Pakistan Peoples Party, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) and Muttahida

                                    <p>BNP chief Khaleda Zia underwent health checkups at Evercare Hospital in the
                                        capital on Thursday.

                                        She arrived at the hospital from her Gulshan residence at around 6:48pm and
                                        stayed there for nearly
                                        five hours, said BNP media cell member Sayrul Kabir Khan.

                                        He said the BNP chairperson underwent several tests at the hospital in line with
                                        the advice of her
                                        medical board.

                                        Later, the BNP chief left the hospital and reached her residence at about
                                        12:15am, he said.

                                        Khaleda's personal physician AZM Zahid Hossain said the medical board formed
                                        earlier, led by Prof
                                        Shahabuddin Talukder, advised her to go for a checkup at the hospital.

                                        "She underwent various necessary medical tests at the hospital,” he said.

                                        Zahid said the medical board will decide the next course of her treatment after
                                        assessing the
                                        reports.

                                        On January 11, the BNP chief returned home from Evercare Hospital after
                                        receiving treatment for
                                        various health complications for over five months.

                                        Since then, she has been receiving treatment at her Gulshan residence under the
                                        medical board formed
                                        earlier at Evercare Hospital.

                                        On August 9 last year, she was admitted to the hospital as she fell sick.

                                        The 78-year-old former prime minister has long been suffering from various
                                        ailments, including liver
                                        cirrhosis, arthritis, diabetes, and issues related to kidney, lung, heart and
                                        eye.

                                        On October 26, three US specialist doctors completed the hepatic procedure known
                                        as transjugular
                                        intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS procedure) to stop water accretion in
                                        Khaleda Zia’s stomach
                                        and chest, and bleeding in her liver.

                                        Khaleda’s doctors have been recommending sending her abroad since she was
                                        diagnosed with liver
                                        cirrhosis in November 2021.

                                        The BNP chief’s family has also sought permission from the government on
                                        different occasions, but
                                        the law minister has said Khaleda has no scope to go abroad for treatment as she
                                        was released on
                                        conditions suspending her sentence in corruption cases.

                                        Since her conditional release from jail in 2020, the BNP chief has been
                                        receiving treatment at the
                                        hospital under a medical board headed by cardiologist Prof Shahabuddin Talukder.

                    battery-run easybike in Khulna’s Dumuria upazila.

                    The accident took place at Angardoha Culvert area under Kharnia union on Khulna-Satkhira highway at
                    around 3:45pm on Saturday.

                    The deceased are Bishwajit Biswas, 30, from Jiyeltala village under Shovna union in the upazila, his
                    two year old daughter Arni Biswas, Nipa Dhali, 25, from Beel Pabla village, Sabbir Moral, 23, from
                    Angardoha village under Kharnia union and an unknown woman aged around 26 years.

                    Two victims died on the spot, two at Dumuria upazila health complex and the child at Khulna Medical
                    College Hospital.

                    Two critically injured persons were admitted to Khulna Medical College hospital. All of them were
                    passengers of the easybike.

                    Kharnia highway police station’s officer-in-charge (OC) Hamid Uddin Ahmed told Prothom Alo that the
                    easybike was heading towards Khulna from Chuknagar. It had seven passengers including the driver. It
                    collided head-on with a brick-laden truck coming from the opposite direction. Two died on the spot
                    while five others were sent to Dumuria upazila health complex.

                    Dumuria police station’s OC Sukanta Saha said the highway police will take legal action over the

                    Afghanistan at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium in Kandy on 9 February 2024.</p>
                <p>Pathum Nissanka became the first Sri Lankan to score an ODI double century, powering the hosts to an
                    immense 381 against Afghanistan at Pallekele in their series opener on Friday.

                    The opener finished unbeaten on 210 to break the island nation's longstanding record of 189 by
                    Sanath Jayasuriya against India in 2000.

                    It was also the joint fifth-highest individual score in ODIs.

                    Sri Lanka's 381-3 was also their highest at the ground and the team's fourth-highest on record.

                    The unstoppable Nissanka's knock included 20 fours and eight sixes from the 139 balls he faced in
                    his first ODI since the World Cup.

                    Avishka Fernando was dismissed for 88 after he was caught by Ibrahim Zadran at backward point in the
                    27th over.

                    Skipper Kusal Mendis took the crease next but failed to make an impact and fell for 16.

                    Sadeera Samarawickrama smashed 44 off 36 deliveries in his 120-run partnership with Nissanka.

                    Fareed Ahmad claimed the wickets of Samarawickrama and Fernando to be the pick of the bowlers with

                <p>Although research is one of the major responsibilities of a university, a concerning trend of
                    ignoring this responsibility persists in some universities across the country.

                    Some 15 per cent of private universities, including some old ones, did not have allocations of a
                    single penny for research in 2022. A similar situation was found in some newly established public
                    universities.

                    Conversely, the prominent universities kept comparatively higher allocations for research, and it is
                    reflected in their overall academic performance, according to the University Grants Commission’s

                <p>Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan was granted bail in 12 cases related to 9 May riots by an
                    anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Rawalpindi, The Express Tribune reported.

                    Additionally, Khan's close aide and the former foreign minister of Pakistan, Shah Mahmud Qureshi was
                    granted bail in 13 cases, the daily reported.

                    Imran was also granted bail in the GHQ and Army Museum attacks, with the court requiring a PKR0.1
                    million surety bond in all 12 cases.

                    The bail applications were considered by ATC judge Malik Ejaz Asif. The court ruled that there was
                    no rationale for keeping the PTI founder in custody, and all suspects in the 9 May cases were
                    granted bail.

                    Imran and Qureshi were indicted as per charges on 6 February. The duo was brought before the court,
                    and the former prime minister informed the judge that he had been unjustly arrested on 9 May from
                    the grounds of the Islamabad High Court (IHC), according to The Express Tribune.

                    Imran was booked in many cases relating to the rioting that erupted throughout the country on 9 May,
                    following his detention in a corruption case. The complaints filed in Rawalpindi included an attack
                    on the gate of General Headquarters (GHQ), rioting at a sensitive institution's office, and other
                    incidents.

                    He rejected the claims included in the cases' first information reports (FIRs).

                    It should be mentioned that, following his release from Adiala jail, PTI leader Shah Mehmood Qureshi
                    was hauled away by Punjab police in connection with the attack on the GHQ, according to The Express
                    Tribune.

                    In July last year, a high-level joint investigative team (JIT) looking into the 9 May violence
                    decided to designate the former premier in two terrorist cases, including an attack on GHQ.

                    With the inclusion of new sections to the proceedings, the PTI head was charged with planning and
                    inciting violence.

                    The bail has been granted to Imran Khan at a time when the results of the Pakistan General Elections
                    that took place on 8 February are highly anticipated.

                    The counting for the elections held on Thursday is underway, and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz
                    (PML-N) has emerged as the single-largest party but is trailing behind the independent candidates,
                    mostly backed by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI).

                    Meanwhile, amid the Election Commission of Pakistan drawing flak over the delay in declaration of
                    the results of the general elections, former PM and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran
                    Khan on Saturday released a 'victory speech' in his AI-enabled voice, saying that the 'London Plan'
                    of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo Nawaz Sharif failed with the massive turnout of
                    voters on polling day, as he also claimed victory in the general elections.

                    Moreover, Nawaz Sharif also announced his intention to form a united government with the help of his
                    former allies - Pakistan Peoples Party, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) and Muttahida Qaumi Movement
                    (Pakistan) amid a fractured mandate.</p>

                    <p>The police recovered a body from Rahmater Beel area in Ukhiya along the Myanmar border today.

                        Mahfuzul Islam, superintendent of Cox’s Bazar police, told Prothom Alo Saturday afternoon that
                        Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) and the police recovered the body of unidentified person from
                        Rahmater Beel area.

                        Local farmers informed the BGB members and police after spotting three to four bodies at the
                        Rahmater Beel area on Friday afternoon. The police could not recover the bodies on Friday due to
                        security reasons as the bodies were lying very close to the border.</p>

                    <p>Myanmar is seeking to repatriate members of its Army, Border Guard Police (BGP), Police,
                        Immigration, and other organisations who have sought refuge in Bangladesh aboard a navy ship.
                        The process is set to commence in the next few days.

                        This development emerged following discussions held during an inter-ministerial meeting chaired
                        by Foreign Secretary Masud Bin Momen on Wednesday. Multiple sources present at the meeting
                        confirmed this information to Prothom Alo. The issue was also raised during talks between
                        Bangladesh's ambassador and Myanmar's foreign minister in Naypyidaw, the administrative capital
                        of Myanmar</p>

                <p>BNP chief Khaleda Zia underwent health checkups at Evercare Hospital in the capital on Thursday.

                    She arrived at the hospital from her Gulshan residence at around 6:48pm and stayed there for nearly
                    five hours, said BNP media cell member Sayrul Kabir Khan.

                    He said the BNP chairperson underwent several tests at the hospital in line with the advice of her
                    medical board.

                    Later, the BNP chief left the hospital and reached her residence at about 12:15am, he said.

                    Khaleda's personal physician AZM Zahid Hossain said the medical board formed earlier, led by Prof
                    Shahabuddin Talukder, advised her to go for a checkup at the hospital.

                    "She underwent various necessary medical tests at the hospital,” he said.

                    Zahid said the medical board will decide the next course of her treatment after assessing the
                    reports.

                    On January 11, the BNP chief returned home from Evercare Hospital after receiving treatment for
                    various health complications for over five months.

                    Since then, she has been receiving treatment at her Gulshan residence under the medical board formed
                    earlier at Evercare Hospital.

                    On August 9 last year, she was admitted to the hospital as she fell sick.

                    The 78-year-old former prime minister has long been suffering from various ailments, including liver
                    cirrhosis, arthritis, diabetes, and issues related to kidney, lung, heart and eye.

                    On October 26, three US specialist doctors completed the hepatic procedure known as transjugular
                    intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS procedure) to stop water accretion in Khaleda Zia’s stomach
                    and chest, and bleeding in her liver.

                    Khaleda’s doctors have been recommending sending her abroad since she was diagnosed with liver
                    cirrhosis in November 2021.

                    The BNP chief’s family has also sought permission from the government on different occasions, but
                    the law minister has said Khaleda has no scope to go abroad for treatment as she was released on
                    conditions suspending her sentence in corruption cases.

                    Since her conditional release from jail in 2020, the BNP chief has been receiving treatment at the
                    hospital under a medical board headed by cardiologist Prof Shahabuddin Talukder.</p>
